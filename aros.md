# AROS

**Creator:** AROS Development Team
**Released:** 1997
**Language:** C and Assembly
**Purpose:** An open-source reimplementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs, designed to be source-compatible while running on modern hardware.

## Features
- Source compatibility with AmigaOS
- Cross-platform (runs on x86, ARM, other architectures)
- Modern hardware support
- Both hosted (runs on top of another OS) and native versions
- Retains the elegant design of the original AmigaOS

## Legacy
The 16/32 bit Amiga presented a high-end machine that became industry standard for audio and video editing. Things didn't work out, but the operating system of those computers is still beloved today.
